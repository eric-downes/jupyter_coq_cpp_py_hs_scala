# jccphs 

Goal: Dockerized jupyter nb in which one can execute commands from as many as possible of the following languages:

We wish to combine these things:
- [Nicola Landro's repo:coq, python, scala](https://gitlab.com/nicolalandro/jupyter-and-coq)
- [Haskell jupyter kernel](https://github.com/IHaskell/IHaskell)
- [C++ jupyter kernel](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling)
- [Rust](https://github.com/google/evcxr/tree/main/evcxr_jupyter)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/winnekes/itypescript)
- [Agda](https://github.com/lclem/agda-kernel)

I'll settle for the first 2-3 for now...
