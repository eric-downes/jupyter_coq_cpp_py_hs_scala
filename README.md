# jccphs 

## Goal

Dockerized jupyter nb in which one can execute commands from as many as possible of the following languages:

- [Nicola Landro's repo:coq, python, scala](https://gitlab.com/nicolalandro/jupyter-and-coq)
- [Haskell jupyter kernel](https://github.com/IHaskell/IHaskell)
- [C++ jupyter kernel](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling)
- [Rust](https://github.com/google/evcxr/tree/main/evcxr_jupyter)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/winnekes/itypescript)
- [Agda](https://github.com/lclem/agda-kernel)

I'll settle for the first 2-3 for now...

## Todo

### setup
[.] Install `jupyter-lab`
[.] Install `docker`

### Landro stuff
[.] check that Landro's docker runs from dockerhub
[] .. built from git
[] remove ijava etc -- still runs?
[] commit here

### Haskell
[] see if I can get the haskell kernel to work with jupyter nb
[] try adding it to Landro's docker file -- still work?

### C++
[] get cling working
[] try adding to the docker file

... and the same for Rust, TypeScript, and Agda
